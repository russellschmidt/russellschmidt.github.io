Not my greatest moment - I should put a dunce cap on my profile picture in Slack.</p>\\n<h2>More jQuery More Problems</h2>\\n<p>I had wanted to correct a few things in my portfolio that I had left hanging as i jumped into the Alexa project. One item was general styling changes, which were straightforward enough with the help of the Chrome Inspector tool. Another, more nagging concern was that my main project carousel was exhibiting some funky behavior that would put Marky Mark and his Funky Bunch in a deluge of tears of shame for they lacked the funk that my funky carousel brought.</p>\\n<h2>The JavaScript</h2>\\n<p>So my carousel has a couple of listeners. When the mouse is on the left side of the image, the cursor turns into a German Shorthair Pointer GET IT pointing left and the decrementCarousel function changes the picture in a decrement fashion. Mouse to the right side of the image and the pointer faces right and calls incrementCarousel.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">var cursorSetOverMainImage = function() {\\n  $('#projectMain').mousemove(function(event){\\n    // left shark\\n    if (event.pageX > imageRectangle.left &#x26;&#x26; event.pageX &#x3C; midline &#x26;&#x26;\\n        event.pageY > imageRectangle.top &#x26;&#x26; event.pageY &#x3C; imageRectangle.bottom){\\n      $('html').css(\\\"cursor\\\", \\\"url(images/leftpointer-sm.png), auto\\\");\\n      $('#projectMain img').click(decrementCarousel);\\n\\n    } else {\\n    // right shark\\n      $('html').css(\\\"cursor\\\", \\\"url(images/rightpointer-sm.png), auto\\\");\\n      $('#projectMain img').click(incrementCarousel);\\n    }\\n  });\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Here are the incrementCarousel and decrementCarousel functions.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">// cycle through carousel images\\nvar CAROUSEL_INDEX = 0;\\n\\nvar incrementCarousel = function() {\\n  CAROUSEL_INDEX++;\\n  if (CAROUSEL_INDEX = projectArray.length){\\n    CAROUSEL_INDEX = 0;\\n  }\\n  nextProject(CAROUSEL_INDEX);\\n};\\n\\nvar decrementCarousel = function() {\\n  CAROUSEL_INDEX--;\\n  if (CAROUSEL_INDEX &#x3C; 0) {\\n    CAROUSEL_INDEX = projectArray.length - 1;\\n  }\\n  nextProject(CAROUSEL_INDEX);\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>The problem</h4>\\n<p>The clicking was producing bizarre behavior - it was not predictable! A click that ought to increment would advance two, not at all, or seem to subtract. Same for decrementing. I only had four items in the carousel but thankful it wasn't two items or I never would have caught this potentially.</p>\\n<p>So, I put in some console logs and got a real surprise.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">// cycle through carousel images\\nvar CAROUSEL_INDEX = 0;\\n\\nvar incrementCarousel = function() {\\nconsole.log(\\\"increment\\\");\\nconsole.log(CAROUSEL_INDEX);\\n  CAROUSEL_INDEX++;\\n  if (CAROUSEL_INDEX = projectArray.length){\\n    CAROUSEL_INDEX = 0;\\n  }\\n  nextProject(CAROUSEL_INDEX);\\nconsole.log(CAROUSEL_INDEX);\\n};\\n\\nvar decrementCarousel = function() {\\nconsole.log(\\\"decrement\\\");\\nconsole.log(CAROUSEL_INDEX);\\n  CAROUSEL_INDEX--;\\n  if (CAROUSEL_INDEX &#x3C; 0) {\\n    CAROUSEL_INDEX = projectArray.length - 1;\\n  }\\n  nextProject(CAROUSEL_INDEX);\\nconsole.log(CAROUSEL_INDEX);\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>The Surprise</h4>\\n<p>Check out the console! <img src=\\\"/images/screenshot-crazylog.png\\\" alt=\\\"cray\\\">. One click was producting just tons and tons of click events. Since I wasn't running a loop from anything touching the listener, I wondered if this was something related to the .click event itself. Maybe some sort of bubbling up event I wasn't anticipating.</p>\\n<h2>No Problemo</h2>\\n<p>Of course, some digging on Stack Overflow mentioned using a different approach with the click. <img src=\\\"/images/no_problemo.png\\\" alt=\\\"No Problemo\\\">  Here is the link  for <a href=\\\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14969960/jquery-click-events-firing-multiple-times\\\">the StackOverflow Solution</a>. Essentially, instead of using .click(), I needed to chain the .off() and then .on() functions. By using the .off(), I unbind all previous events from the event.</p>\\n<p>What is happening under the hood is that jQuery is adding a new function on each click, and not just calling the function on the click. So this problem escalates quickly and compounds! And true to form, on each click, my console log grew longer than the prior click - it was getting worse, and I could see my site performance perceptibly degrade. Using .off() will clear all prior bindings and now we get the behavior we expect.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">var cursorSetOverMainImage = function() {\\n  $('#projectMain').mousemove(function(event){\\n    // left shark\\n    if (event.pageX > imageRectangle.left &#x26;&#x26; event.pageX &#x3C; midline &#x26;&#x26;\\n        event.pageY > imageRectangle.top &#x26;&#x26; event.pageY &#x3C; imageRectangle.bottom){\\n      $('html').css(\\\"cursor\\\", \\\"url(images/leftpointer-sm.png), auto\\\");\\n      $('#projectMain img').off().on('click', decrementCarousel);\\n\\n    } else {\\n    // right shark\\n      $('html').css(\\\"cursor\\\", \\\"url(images/rightpointer-sm.png), auto\\\");\\n      $('#projectMain img').off().on('click', incrementCarousel);\\n    }\\n\\n  });\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<h3>Even Better Solutions</h3>\\n<p>Calling .on() and .off() feels a little off. I am not really changing a state, which is what on and off represent, I just want a freaking picture to change on a click. Maybe I am splitting hairs, maybe a new picture is a new state. My instinct is that while this is syntactically weird, it works now, and rewriting everything in JavaScript to get a more perfect click event is not cost-effective.</p>\\n<p>And yes, while you can use the tried and true .onclick() from vanilla JavaScript, there is another way. You can use <code>.one('click', function())</code> but that only works once per page so a terrible solution for a carousel. No, a better solution might be inserting this <code>event.stopImmediatePropagation();</code> into your .click() function call as the first line - it kills all further bubbling up and it reads more logically - it is self-evident what it does. Unfortunately, this  will not work for me, as it resets the global counter variable I need to make the carousel work.
