I actually really like the tutorial on building a Pinterest clone on <a href=\\\"https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails/curriculum\\\">One Month Rails</a> if you want a step by step introduction to setting up Devise and Paperclip.

It fills in a couple of details that the Github documentation leaves out.</p>\\n<p>What if I want to attach multiple photos? The way Paperclip works, it associates one image with one model object. So if I want multiple photos to be associated with each project, I would need either to create different attributes for each photo on my model, which with Paperclip is 4 attributes per, or create a new model, say, 'Images', and have Images belong to Projects. This dual model approach is more flexible, since I can just dynamically add photos, but also is a bigger pain in the ass to implement. My heart says dual model but my brain says additional attributes.</p>\\n<p>The argument for just adding the attributes onto the existing model is:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Realistically, how many photos can we possibly want to use? I suppose we might want a gallery feature one day. And we can go ahead and implement that when we have the need. It seems like premature optimization and scope creep before we even know we need it.</li>\\n<li>Drill baby drill. Or, rather, ship baby ship. Anything that is going to add complexity adds time, and I aint got time for that.</li>\\n<li>It will be easier to implement a system to make changes for admins with the photos as attributes.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The counterarguments are:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>It is something of a jumble of concerns for a project model to also hold information about images. The photos are not central to That Thing Which is a Project, though that this not a slam dunk of an argument.</li>\\n<li>Creating image attributes in the Project model is brittle, creating them as their own model makes them dynamic.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>A good Tutorial is hard to find</h3>\\n<p>And then <a href=\\\"http://www.railscook.com/recipes/multiple-files-upload-with-nested-resource-using-paperclip-in-rails/\\\">I find this tutorial</a> with the Github repo that makes sense and think I should just do this the gangster way, the right way.

There is a bit more to add to the Picture model. We add the standard sizes are going to convert images into - it makes sense to pick a standard ratio so you know what you will be getting on a resize.
