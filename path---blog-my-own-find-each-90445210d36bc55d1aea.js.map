It is a great overview of <code>block</code> and <code>yield</code> in Ruby.</p>\\n<h3>Block</h3>\\n<p>A <code>block</code> is generally a method that you pass into another method. They are very common in Ruby, with the familiar syntax of:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-ruby\\\">anArray.map { |el| puts \\\"this is #{el}\\\" }\\n\\n# or\\n\\nsomeObjectList.each do |obj|\\n    puts obj.name\\nend\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The blocks here are what is between the curlies {} and do/end pairs. We declare a temp variable representing the current element of the collection by putting it between pipes || (called the 'block parameter') and then run the code inside the do/end or curlies. Here, we had the code output something regarding the current element to console, but we could just as well output something random.</p>\\n<p>There is nothing to a block! You've been using it all along. It is just some code you pass in to a do-end or {}.</p>\\n<h3><code>&#x26;amp;Block</code></h3>\\n<p>If you want to pass in a method to Ruby as an argument, you can! Why not? The <code>&#x26;amp;Block</code> syntax is pretty common in Ruby, so it is good for me to really get my head around this.</p>\\n<p>We use <code>&#x26;amp;Block</code> to pass a reference to a block into the code. Here is an example I made from tooling around in irb.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">2.3.0 :009 > def textmagic(word, &#x26;block)\\n2.3.0 :010?>   block.call(word)\\n2.3.0 :011?>   end\\n => :textmagic\\n2.3.0 :012 > textmagic(\\\"magic\\\"){|w| puts \\\"w\\\"}\\nw\\n => nil\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>So I have a block in my arguments. I can then reference said block inside my method, and even pass in a local variable to the block parameter. Note that I call the block with <code>block.call</code> - pretty straightforward.</p>\\n<h3>Yield</h3>\\n<p>What <code>yield</code> does in Ruby is identical to writing <code>block.call</code>! Just some syntactic sugar, sweet thing. It runs the block passed inside the method. In other words, it specifies where in the method the additional code you are inserting via block is going to go.</p>\\n<p>With do/end and {}, we are running the code between the magic words or curlies. In a typical use case, we are iterating over a collection and applying the block to each element. However, with a method we write, we might need a more nuanced application of the block. <code>Yield</code> allows for a custom placement of the code block within the method, with optional arguments passed to <code>yield(arg1, arg2...)</code> then as before becoming available as block parameters.</p>\\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\\n<p>Blocks and Yields have taken me a while to wrap my head around, despite, in hindsight, realizing that anonymous functions in JavaScript, which I use all the time as callbacks and whatnot, are blocks.
