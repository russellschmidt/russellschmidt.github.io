This is a checklist developed by Richard Feldman so as to answer YES to the questions below:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?</li>\\n<li>Did you work with classmates on homework problems or check your solutions?</li>\\n<li>Did you try to outline each homework problem before working with classmates?</li>\\n<li>Did you participate in group discussions contributing ideas and asking questions?</li>\\n<li>Did you consult with the instructor or teaching assistants when you were having trouble with something?</li>\\n<li>Did you understand the problem solutions when they were handed in?</li>\\n<li>Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions that weren't clear to you?</li>\\n<li>Did you go through your study guide carefully until you were convinced you could do everything on it?</li>\\n<li>Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly without spending time on the calculations?</li>\\n<li>Did you quiz fellow students on the study guide?</li>\\n<li>Did you attend and participate in the test review session?</li>\\n<li>Most importantly, did you get a reasonable night's sleep the evening prior?</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h3>Hard Start, Jump to Easy</h3>\\n<p>Don't do the easiest problems first. Try to start the hardest problems first as they take the most time. Also, you want to access diffuse mode. So, start with hard problems after a quick scan of the test. Do the hardest problem for a minute, and then move on if you get stuck. It loads the hard problem in your brain but then kicks in your diffuse mode when you switch to a different problem. Alternate between hard and easy problems. Think of it like being a chef with great time management, bouncing between dishes to use your brain more efficiently. It gets some work done on each problem, and kicks in diffuse mode so you can overcome Einstellung. You do really need to have the discipline to switch when you are stuck after a minute or two. Of course, this assumes you studied effectively.</p>\\n<h3>Final Test Advice</h3>\\n<p>Stress causes the body to release cortisol. Cortisol can induce panic or make people pumped - this is up to you! Try breathing exercises if the cortisol response is causing you to panic instead of turn into a test ninja. Practice breathing and get into a deep breathing pattern near the end of the test.</p>\\n<p>Some techniques are:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Cover multiple choice answers before answering - see if something comes to you</li>\\n<li>Try relaxing your tongue</li>\\n<li>Face your fears ahead of the test</li>\\n<li>Plan for an alternative / worst case scenario with career. This releases stress so you perform better.</li>\\n<li>Good worry / bad worry - be sure to stay focused but not lose your mind</li>\\n<li>Day prior do a review but take it easy.</li>\\n<li>Double check your answers by blinking and shifting your attention</li>\\n<li>Gut checks are important. Make sure your answers make sense, units of measurement make sense.</li>\\n<li>Switch up how you check your answers - maybe work back to front</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Try to shift your mindset from 'I am afraid' to 'I am going to tear this test into pieces and eat its goddamn face' and see your performance improve :)</p>\\n<h3>Wrap.
