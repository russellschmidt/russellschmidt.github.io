There is much more to learn about Procrastination, of course, and we are going to dive in this week in <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\">Coursera's Learning How To Learn</a> course.</p>\n<h4>Why do I care</h4>\n<p>Well you care because</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Procrastination is a really terrible habit to build</li>\n<li>Procrastination is like addiction neurologically</li>\n<li>Learning is more effective in small pieces across time and is ineffective crammed into short times, which is what you are left with when you procrastinate.</li>\n<li>Procrastination causes us to feel stress, from guilt, from looming deadlines, from fear that we have given into, and stress makes it harder to learn, and becomes self-defeating.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And your life looks awesome if you beat procrastination.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using willpower to combat procrastination takes energy, and so we need to use some jujitsu to avoid even needing willpower to avoid procrastinating. Then we have willpower to spare.</li>\n<li>Studying is less stressful if you can incorporate better study habits into your life.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Chunks and Habits</h3>\n<p>Habits are energy savers, as are chunks when we think about the brain. Habits turn us into brain dead zombies, so we can, say, daydream while we walk.</p>\n<p>Habits have 4 parts</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The cue - the trigger that turns us into a zombie</li>\n<li>The routine - the responses and processes we use when we are a zombie</li>\n<li>The reward - habits are made and continue because of rewards</li>\n<li>The belief - habits have power because we believe in them</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Process versus Product</h3>\n<p>Overcoming procrastination requires the following. First, accept your negative feelings, and know that it will get better once you get started. Focus on process and not product. Process is a behavior set against the flow of time. Product is the outcome. Process for me is coding for 25 minutes. Product is figuring out how to upload video to a rails project.</p>\n<p>Product intimidates and causes bargaining to start. Product is where pain is triggered that causes us to procrastinate.</p>\n<p>Process is focused on the moment. Pomodoro is process, a finite moment. The Zombie part of our brains loves process, our bodies are built to grind in small pieces and get in the flow. We can stop meta-thoughts about our progress and the amout of work left, or distractions. By focusing on the process, the time and not the output, we can build a habit and build that wall, brick by brick.</p>\n<p>I wish I had this kind of discipline in college when I always saved everything for the last minute.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"May 10, 2016",path:"/blog/procrastination/",title:"Procrastination",type:"blog"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
