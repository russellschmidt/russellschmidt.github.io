Update with <code>brew update node</code> and uninstall with <code>brew uninstall node</code> - pretty easy.</p>\\n<p>Now install Grunt\\n<code>$ npm install -g grunt-cli</code></p>\\n<p>You should get a nicely formatted 'Fatal Error' page.</p>\\n<p>When the time comes, you can run <code>grunt</code> and go to localhost:3000 to see your magical site.</p>\\n<h3>Root it Out</h3>\\n<p>Go to your project's home page in command line and <code>$ npm init</code>. Next follow the prompts to make your manifest file, inputting the name, description, keywords, and people fields.</p>\\n<p>Then <code>$ npm install grunt --save-dev</code> will get grunt installed as a dependency under the dev environment.</p>\\n<h3>Grunties</h3>\\n<p>In the home folder of your project, make a file <code>Gruntfile.js</code> in the root directory. For reasons unknown at this point, this is required.</p>\\n<p>Make sure your Gruntfile has all of its Grunt logic in a <code>module.exports</code> function expression.\\n<code>JavaScript module.exports = function(grunt) { // magical code here };</code></p>\\n<p>The <code>grunt</code> argument is apparently required - or at least one convention says to name it that, while you <em>are</em> required to have at least one argument. <code>module.exports</code> is Node convention.</p>\\n<p>The fundamental unit of Grunt is a task. I would like Grunt more if the fundamental unit was called a 'grunt' - huge missed opportunity. Every task in Grunt is first registered inside that function we made.</p>\\n<p><code>JavaScript grunt.registerTask('default', 'Testing out Grunt logging and task callbacks', function() { grunt.log.writeln('This is our first Grunt task! Why isn't this HELLO WORLD'); });</code></p>\\n<p>Note that the registerTask takes 3 arguments - a string naming the task, a description of the task in String form, and a callback that runs with the task. You can run this task with an incredible complicated command:</p>\\n<p><code>bash $ grunt</code></p>\\n<p>Now all your GruntDreams came true.</p>\\n<p>You can use names beside 'default' and then run them simply by typing <code>$ grunt name-you-put-in</code> and you are off to the proverbial races.</p>\\n<h3>Many Grunts</h3>\\n<p>You can, instead of a single calback in your Grunt registerTask(), you can pass in an array of subtasks (so, <code>['task1', 'task2']</code> instead of the callback).</p>\\n<p>You can install grunt plugins easily, too.</p>\\n<p><code>npm install grunt-some-plugin --save-dev</code></p>\\n<p>A popular grunt plugin is 'grunt-contrib-watch' that watches specified files for changes and runs code when the file is saved.</p>\\n<p>Once installed, you can run these plugins within the Gruntfile.</p>\\n<p><code>grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');</code></p>\\n<p>We can specify which files we want to watch with this plugin with</p>\\n<p><code>JavaScript grunt.initConfig({ watch: { files: ['Gruntfile.js'] } });</code></p>\\n<p>The run <code>grunt watch</code> from the command line, only hitting CTRL C to exit.</p>\\n<h3>Globs of Grunts</h3>\\n<p>Just like we had a watch property, there is a files property that goes into the initConfig. In <code>files: { }</code> we can put 'globbing patterns' (wildcard functionality) to look for <em>types of files</em> instead of specific filenames. For example:</p>\\n<p><code>JavaScript files: [ './css/*', './images/*.{png,jpg,svg}', './assets/**/*.{png,jpg,svg,otf,ttf}' ]</code></p>\\n<p>The * indicates 'select any file of that type in that directory.\\nWe use { }  to specify multiple file extensions, here all types of image files in the /images/ directory.\\nLastly, ** means any subdirectory.  So, <code>images/ * * / *. {png, jpg, gif, tiff}</code> is saying look in the subdirectories of images for any image file.</p>\\n<h3>Patterns of Grunting</h3>\\n<p>A common use of Grunt is taking a file or a pile of files, changing or copying the content, and putting the modified content in a different directory.
