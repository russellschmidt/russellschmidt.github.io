I struggle to do this with Gatsby because out of the box, you don\'t touch HTML file. In fact, I had no idea where this was in the Gatsby file structure. There are I believe 8 "html.js" files in the barebones implementation. Fortunately the generally excellent Gatsby documentation <a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/5.html">has a section on html.js</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you have copied the <code>html.js</code> file to your <code>src</code> folder (<code>$ cp .cache/default-html.js src/html.js</code>), you can copy your normal favicon links into the <code>&#x3C;head></code>. Copy your favicon files into <code>/static/</code> and away we go - this works on my dev server. It definitely has not worked on my Github Pages production site. Hmmm...</p>\n<p>I hate to use a plugin, but I think I need to in this case given the paucity of information I found about the inner workings of Favicons and Gatsby and the potential that this is just an annoying Github issue I don\'t care to dive into. Whaddya know, there is a plugin for <a href="https://github.com/Creatiwity/gatsby-plugin-favicon">just this sort of thing</a>.</p>',frontmatter:{date:null,path:"/blog/favicon-fever/",title:"Favicon Fever",type:"blog"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
