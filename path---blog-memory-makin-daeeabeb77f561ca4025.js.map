Humans did not evolve to remember phone numbers and abstract concepts. We have incredible spatial and visual systems in our brains to help us recall locations of food, water and shelter.

A famous patient HM had both hippocampuses removed and lost the ability to form new long term memories. Memories are living, breathing parts of the brain. Simply recalling a memory causes the memory itself to changes - this is a process called reconsolidation. We can even implant false memories in people, especially impressionable kids, through suggestion and imaging.</p>\\n<p>New memories are formed using the hippocampus, and then stored in the cortex. This process is called memory consolidation. It can take years to solidify memories.</p>\\n<p>The consolidation process involves first the brain taking a chunk (state) from active working memory to long term memory by modifying the dendrites of neurons. Once encoded, these memories can be dormant for a long time. When we reactivate the memory, we are taking the chunk and moving it to working memory. The old memory is actually changed when we do this. Memories become intertwined as new connections between brain cells are made, and old memories as well as new memories change. We also perform reconsolidation while we sleep. This is why cramming the night before is not a good strategy for learning.</p>\\n<h3>Astrocytes</h3>\\n<p>Glial cells are brain support cells, and astrocytes are a type of glial cell. They happen to be the most common glial cell in the human brain. They provide nutrients to neurons, maintain extra-cellular ion balance, and repair other cells following injury. Astrocyte cells have long arms that wrap around neurons providing a loving embrace where they feed, fix, and ion-balance the brain cells.</p>\\n<p>Experiments have shown that human astrocyte cells, when placed in mice, improve mice learning times. So a fourth feature of astrocytes seem to be some sort of relationship to learning ability. Also, when Einstein donated his brain to science post-mortem, it was found that he seemed to have more astrocytes than an average brain.</p>\\n<h3>The Memory Palace</h3>\\n<p>Create groups to remember things, and tie these things to images. So, for example, when needing to remember a number, associate digits with meaningful things from life, history, or feelings. Mnemonic devices are also incredibly helpful - we can take a collection of things and using the first letter of each make a song, rhyme or phrase that sticks with us.</p>\\n<p>The <strong>Memory Palace technique</strong> ties a visual such as an image, map or layout that can serve as a notepad to group unrelated items. Imagine, say, items you need for a shopping list posted up in your childhood home, so you have a jarring visual of a giant gallon of milk jug on your couch, eggs on your ottoman, and so on. This inserts the things you want to remember into a scene you remember well using your built-in awesome visual memory. With practice, you can measure about 95% of a 40-50 item list. Memory then becomes a creative activity, and build more hooks between chunks. As a side benefit we are also becoming more creative as we build evocative images when we try to get better at this. It taps into our oft-buried creativity we put aside when we were kids.</p>\\n<h3>Summing it up</h3>\\n<p>Humans have two memory systems - working memory and long term memory. RAM and ROM. We need to spend time to build connections into long term memory with repetition over time. Human working memory (RAM) only has 4 slots. We can compact ideas in working memory, however, freeing up resources. We also have an amazing visual memory system where we can associate sensory perceptions with memories to learn things faster.
