I have a Projects model already that has some basic content. I want to enable people to upload images and associate them with a specific project. Later on, I hope to add in permissions so only Admins can access add/change/delete, and automate thumbnails so that on the /index page, relevant pictures show up automatically.</p>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>There are three popular plugins available for Ruby on Rails: <strong>Paperclip</strong>, <strong>CarrierWave</strong> and <strong>Dragonfly</strong>.</p>\n<h5>Github Repo\'s</h5>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave">CarrierWave</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/markevans/dragonfly">Dragonfly</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>ImageMagick</h2>\n<p>Everyone needs <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to run. It processes images, reading and writing from all the varied image file formats in the wild.</p>\n<h4>First Steps</h4>\n<p>Get ImageMagick loaded. <code>brew install imagemagick</code> and you should have <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.</p>\n<p>If you also want to install GhostScript for fun PDF uploads. <code>brew install gs</code>.</p>\n<p>Add <code>gem "paperclip"</code> to your Gemfile.</p>\n<p>And of course, stop your Rails server, <code>bundle</code> and restart. Proceed if your site is not destroyed.</p>\n<h3>Paperclip (RIP Clippy)</h3>\n<p>We all miss you Clippy. <img src="/images/clippy1.jpg" alt="Clippy"></p>\n<p>We need to add a model for our images. I\'m going to use Rails scaffolding because that\'s what refactoring is for <code>rails g scaffold paperclip_image --skip-assets</code>. (Run first with the -p flag for "pretend" on the end to see what it would do).</p>',frontmatter:{date:"May 14, 2016",path:"/blog/picture-me-rolling/",title:"Picture Me Rolling",type:"blog"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
