You can <a href="ancient-peak-81208.herokuapp.com">find it here</a> and turn those speakers way way up.</p>\n<h4>Keep the Node Alive</h4>\n<p>I had a question for my mentor regarding the easiest way to run a Node app on the inter-webs. I know how to do things old school from a PHP server management persective at a hobbyist level, FTPing files in. I was not as sure about Node and how that all works. Mentor Man said to check out Heroku, where I had an account for the rails projects.</p>\n<h4>Node on Heroku</h4>\n<p>The <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction">instructions for loading a Node-only app</a> on Heroku could not be easier so that is the good news.</p>\n<p>Here are the steps.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make heroku account</li>\n<li>Load Heroku Dev Toolbelt</li>\n<li>Log into heroku from command line - this assumes you are using git, bee tee dubs.</li>\n<li>navigate in bash to the project root folder</li>\n<li><code>$ heroku create</code></li>\n<li><code>$ git push heroku master</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>DONE</strong></p>\n<p>Heroku has a couple more steps to make sure your app is good to go.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>$ heroku ps:scale web=1</code> this makes sure one of your 3 free dynos on heroku is assigned</li>\n<li><code>$ heroku open</code> opens the website in your default browser</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having a bit of a Heroku-inspired confusion because the email verification plug in I was using from Mailgun ended Heroku support without a paid account. I knew this and saw it coming but was too busy with all these projects to get involved, but now that I went deep into the weeds, might as well try and fix it. Heroku helpfully put the app to sleep for now.</p>\n<p>Another naughty bit is that my pictures and icons and custom fonts all disappeared, and they are all being pulled off a CDN. I have a suspicion that if I went to a paid account this might resolve itself because I am a cynical bastard.</p>\n<h1>UPDATE</h1>\n<p>That problem resolved itself and my vile cynicism was unwarranted. ITS ALIVE!!!!</p>\n<h4>Future Bloc Jams</h4>\n<p>Currently there are 12 identical albums on there. I would like to at least have 12 different albums on the site - its a bit boring!</p>\n<p>Some ideas from Bloc were creating user profiles, sharing music and creating playlists.</p>\n<h4>Future tech project</h4>\n<p>I have 6 apps now on Heroku that I am proud of and wished were all up and running. I have the one I am paying for - climatecents.org - which is a long-term project I am on, and then 3 of the free plans.</p>\n<p>At $7 a month per app, I would be paying $21 a month to host the three extra apps. I wonder at what point I should be looking at a Digital Ocean or other inexpensive VPS solution. Since I am rich in old laptops and computers, I also might want to self host with a static IP, though that is a very old school solution and will not have great performance over my internet with its not incredible upload speeds.</p>',frontmatter:{date:"April 28, 2016",path:"/blog/bloc-jams/",title:"Bloc Jams",type:"blog"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
