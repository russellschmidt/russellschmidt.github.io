Time to make my own AngularJS project. I am going to make a Pomodoro counter, so inspired by the learning to learn course am I. In short, this is a web based counter that is a 30 minute timer. For 25 minutes, the user will focus and be distraction free. For 5 minutes, the user rests their brain and day dreams and does anything but focus on the prior task.
