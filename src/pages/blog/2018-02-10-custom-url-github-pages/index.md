Are you screaming in silence every time you deploy your Gatsby blog because your custom URL has to be manually reset in Github Pages?

I got you fam.

In the root of your project folder, create a directory called 'static'.

In that folder, create a file, call it 'CNAME' in caps with no file extension.

In your favorite text editor, open CNAME and type in the domain name and TLD. For example, for my site, the entire file contents are

```
russellschmidt.net
```

That's it.
