I don't know what happened but I was too frustrated and tired on a Friday night to troubleshoot after manually updating 80 blog posts. So I watched two episodes of Altered Carbon.</p>\n<p>Upon waking, I had to inexplicably reload three of the packages and everything came back up. This is concerning but I'll chalk it up to something I did late at night for now. Then I sketched out how I want this blog to look, which of course means that I need to make some serious changes to <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-react-and-gatsby-powered-blog-in-about-10-minutes-625c35c06481\">this wonderful tutorial</a> I was using as a guide.</p>\n<p>The mobile site - and I am trying to design mobile first with all projects - is going to have a top home button with my name or logo that links to the homepage. At the bottom will be three page links on a fixed panel: blog, portfolio, about. Once you have selected blog or portfolio, we want an infinite scroll effect for the section's main page and then show a previous/next button on detail. Ideally all the buttons are near the bottom so I can use my tiny baby hands easily.</p>\n<p>The about section will have images I have made and some biographical info. I am considering social links and contact me there, though I should have some basic ones on the homepage I think. I think I want a slideshow of images or perhaps an instagram feed.</p>\n<p>For the portfolio detail and blog post detail, there should also be social share options for linkedin, twitter and facebook. For the images, maybe a pinterest and tumblr share option, too.</p>\n<p>Ideally I want the home page to just have a giant spinning head (mine) that you can rotate on a mouseover because it would be funny. I think a call to action for hiring me as a developer might make sense there too so it can't suck.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"February 10, 2018",path:"/blog/a-milli/",title:"A Milli",type:"blog"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
