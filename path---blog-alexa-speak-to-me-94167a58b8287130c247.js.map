There are actually two distinct parts to the code you will want to address, but the good news is you can leave most of it alone. Or rather, you ought to leave most of it alone if you know what's good for you.</p>\\n<h4>Index.js part one</h4>\\n<p>In the <code>index.js</code> file, you will want to delete the existing reindeer questions and put in your own trivia questions in the <code>questions</code> array. Each item in the array is an object where the <code>name</code> is the question and the <code>value</code> is an array of answers, of which the first item at index zero must be the correct one.</p>\\n<p>I put all of the presidents of the USA in an array in order of their election. Yes, Stephen Grover Cleveland is both the 22nd and 24th President in that convention, as the only President to have served non-consecutive terms. Yes, that is one of the many amazing trivia questions asked in my skill.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">var questions = [\\n    {\\n        \\\"Who was the first U.S. President?\\\": [\\n            potusArray[0].fullName,\\n            potusArray[1].fullName,\\n            potusArray[2].fullName,\\n            potusArray[3].fullName,\\n            potusArray[4].fullName\\n        ]\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \\\"Who was the second U.S. President?\\\": [\\n            potusArray[1].fullName,\\n            potusArray[2].fullName,\\n            potusArray[3].fullName,\\n            potusArray[4].fullName,\\n            potusArray[5].fullName\\n        ]\\n    },\\n    ...\\n  ];\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>Index.js part two</h4>\\n<p>This is the only other part of the code you need to be concered with.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-JavaScript\\\">// ------- Skill specific business logic -------\\n\\nvar ANSWER_COUNT = 4;\\nvar GAME_LENGTH = 5;\\nvar CARD_TITLE = \\\"United States of America Presidential Trivia\\\"; // Be sure to change this for your skill.\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Make sure your official Skill name matches the <code>CARD_TITLE</code> global variable value you assign.

You can actually put in more than 4 answers in your code, and what this skill cleverly does is randomizes the incorrect answers in the <code>populateRoundAnswers()</code> function.</p>\\n<p>Following the code below, first, the function makes sure you have enough answers for the question. Then, the incorrect answers are randomized (or shuffled, as Amazon refers to it). Note the index starts at 1 and not 0 to make sure we don't lose the right answer. Lastly, the correct answer is inserted into the array of answers at index 0.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-JavaScript\\\">function populateRoundAnswers(gameQuestionIndexes, correctAnswerIndex, correctAnswerTargetLocation) {\\n    // Get the answers for a given question, and place the correct answer at the spot marked by the\\n    // correctAnswerTargetLocation variable.
