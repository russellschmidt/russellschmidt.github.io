## Happy Sorta-Anniversary
Happy day to me. Five Months of blogging, much of which has dried up of late. Sorry, millions of readers.

## Heap of Fun
So in the Software Engineering Track with Bloc, we are aiming to dive a bit deeper into designing software so as to understand the choices and tradeoffs of various design decisions. I began this track a few weeks ago and it has been kicking my butt.

The 25-hour per week commitment had normally, for me at least, had been very doable and certainly was a bit lumpy. Some assignments I found easy, others were really hard, but overall I didn't doubt my decision to sell my business and change my career. The SET program has been difficult enough that I brought it up in therapy and was starting to doubt myself and my abilities. I haven't had a challenge like this since Harvard where I took upper division classes to challenge myself and was lucky to get out of there alive let alone with a 'B'.

In a way, the difficulty makes me glad, because it means I am learning and am in the right program, and will give me some confidence going forward, whether in technical interviews for a job or when facing a challenge building something for myself. Pollyanna-ish self affirmations aside, though, I am in the thick of it and as mentioned it is kicking my ass. Learning to code to implement algorithms and data structures is a far different proposition than making websites. My code is already much cleaner and I am thinking about processor cycles and other performance-impacting design choices that I honestly never considered before.

This morning I was fantasizing about quitting the program. I spoke with my awesome mentor Cyle and asked him where I stood. I was considering freezing the program to catch up. He mentioned that I was having the least trouble of his current slate of students. Now he could be lying and he has something of a financial interest in keeping me in the program, but why the superlative? This is not to brag. I write this because programming is the hardest intellectual pursuit I have chased in the last decade and even when I am doing apparently pretty great I feel like slime a lot of the time. Now I feel like slime a lot anyway but that is what weekly therapy is for.

## Conclusion
Anything worth doing is difficult, at least at times. I get a genuine rush from making something work, from figuring out a puzzle, and from showing off my creations. SET is helping me learn how to make the beautiful, concise, clever code that I saw in CodeWars katas. At times, I think I am a stupid idiot and get stuck for hours or days. A lesson I am learning is pulling out of the tailspin and getting back to my training to dissect problems and talk myself through them.
